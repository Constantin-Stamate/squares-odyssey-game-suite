## 🏛️ About

**The Squares' Odyssey** is an interactive JavaFX game suite that reimagines the spirit of the Ancient Olympic Games through a trilogy of modern, logic-based challenges. Rooted in Greek mythology and inspired by the competitive essence of Olympia, this application transforms traditional athletic values into mental feats of strength, agility, and precision.

The project was developed using **JavaFX**, **Maven**, and **Object-Oriented Programming**, combining dynamic visual interfaces with a modular and well-structured architecture. The core challenge was to create a seamless, immersive experience through animated transitions, while reflecting the symbolic depth of Greek mythology in each mini-game’s mechanics and interface.

## ⚡ Key Features

1. **The Game Selection**  
   Three gods are represented here in divine form, and each god corresponds to a specific game. Your choice leads you into a unique challenge inspired by the greatness and competitive spirit of the ancient Greek Olympics. The gods will test your logic, memory, and reflexes, offering you the chance to rise to their level. This is not just a simple selection — it marks the beginning of a journey toward mastery and eternal glory.

2. **The Battle of Gods**  
   A strategic game where players must use logic and quick reflexes to prevail. The game generates a secret combination of 4 digits, and players must guess it. If they guess both the digit and its position correctly, they unlock a god. If they only guess the digit correctly, they unlock a goddess. Players have 7 attempts to guess the correct combination. Each successful guess brings players closer to mastering the divine power and winning the game.

3. **Winning Medal in The Battle of Gods**  
   In **The Battle of Gods**, players can earn a special medal when they successfully guess the secret 4-digit combination within 7 attempts. Upon winning, a medal will be displayed on the screen, accompanied by a festive confetti animation. The medal symbolizes the player's ability to face the gods and overcome their challenges.

4. **Failure in The Battle of Gods**  
   If the player fails to guess the secret 4-digit combination within the 7 attempts, the game will show a "failure" page, featuring depressed athletes symbolizing the disappointment of the loss. The page will also encourage the player to try again and challenge the gods once more.

5. **The Sliding Puzzle**  
   A test of mental agility and perseverance, inspired by the races and physical challenges of the Olympics. Players must rearrange tiles to form a complete image, using logic and strategic moves to solve the puzzle. The challenge increases as the difficulty level rises, testing both patience and skill. If the shuffle algorithm results in an odd number of inversions, the puzzle becomes unsolvable, and the player automatically loses. In this case, a new game session must be started to play again.

6. **Winning Medal in The Sliding Puzzle**  
   In **The Sliding Puzzle**, players can earn a special medal when they successfully rearrange the puzzle pieces to form the correct image. Once the puzzle is solved correctly, the completed image will appear, and the player will be awarded a medal symbolizing their skill in overcoming the challenge. The celebration includes an animation that marks the player's victory.

7. **Failure in The Sliding Puzzle**  
   If the puzzle pieces are shuffled an odd number of times, it will be impossible to solve the puzzle. In this case, the game will display a "failure" page, encouraging the player to try again. The image of athletes with disappointed expressions will be shown to symbolize the loss.

8. **Memory Mastery**  
   A memory game reflecting the precision and focus required by Olympic archers. Players must flip over cards featuring symbols from ancient Greek Olympic games. If the revealed pair matches, it remains open — otherwise, the cards flip back down. The player has 15 attempts to find all the matching pairs and win the game. Each round tests memory, concentration, and attention to detail.
